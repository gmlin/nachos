/**
 * This class is patterned after the SynchronousQueue class
 * in the java.util.concurrent package.
 *
 * A SynchronousQueue has no capacity: each insert operation
 * must wait for a corresponding remove operation by another
 * thread, and vice versa.  A thread trying to insert an object
 * enters a queue with other such threads, where it waits to
 * be matched up with a thread trying to remove an object.
 * Similarly, a thread trying to remove an object enters a
 * queue with other such threads, where it waits to be matched
 * up with a thread trying to insert an object.
 * If there is at least one thread waiting to insert and one
 * waiting to remove, the first thread in the insertion queue
 * is matched up with the first thread in the removal queue
 * and both threads are allowed to proceed, after transferring
 * the object being inserted to the thread trying to remove it.
 * At any given time, the <EM>head</EM> of the queue is the
 * object that the first thread on the insertion queue is trying
 * to insert, if there is any such thread, otherwise the head of
 * the queue is null.
