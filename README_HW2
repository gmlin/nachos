# Physical Memory Manager

I created a simple physical memory manager class called MemoryManager.
It keeps track of the next unallocated page number as well as a data
structure to keep track of pages that are freed. When a AddrSpace asks
for memory, the MemoryManager either removes a page number from
freedPages and return it, or returns the next unallocated page number
and increment. I also needed to use a lock for synchronization.

# Virtual Address Translation

For each TranslationEntry object, instead of setting the physicalPage
field to the same value as the virtualPage field, I set it to the
page number returned by MemoryManager getUnusedPage method. I also
had to make sure that I was reading and writing to the correct addresses,
taking note that at the end of a physical page, I need to jump to the
next physical page associated with the next virtual page. I wrote a
couple of methods such as the translate method which would make this
easier.

# Exec System Call

To implement Exec, I realized that I would need a lot of the same code
that was already in the ProgTest class. I refactored it into a class
called UserProgram. I created a new constructor for UserPrograms
started via Exec. I had to find a way to get the String at the pointer
stored in the R4 register so I created a method in AddrSpace which
returns the String stored at an address. By then, Exec was able to
run the program specified by the function argument but it still had to
return the SpaceId. For this, I created a class called ProcessTable
which would associate a given AddrSpace with an assigned spaceId.
The assigned spaceId would then be returned by Exec.

# Fork System Call

To implement Fork, I needed to allow multiple UserThreads to reside
within a single AddrSpace. I could no longer use a single page table
because the different UserThreads would use the same code and data
segments but different stacks. I created a Map of UserThreads to
page tables to map each UserThread to its page table. I updated all
the existing methods to reflect this. To share the code and data
segments, I created a basePageTable field which contains just the
TranslationEntries for the code and data segment. I would then
use this basePageTable as the base to construct page tables for
subsequent UserThreads that use this AddrSpace. I added a new
constructor to UserProgram which takes a UserThread and function
pointer to create a UserProgram that shares the same AddrSpace
and starts execution at the function's address. I added a boolean
to keep track of whether the program is forked or not so the
appropriate code is run in the run method. In the run method,
the forked program updates the MIPS program counters so that
when it executes, it will start at the function whose pointer
was provided as the argument to Fork.

# Exit System Call

When Exit is called, the UserThread that calls it is removed from the
List of UserThreads in the AddrSpace. The UserThread's stack memory is
freed.  If there are no more UserThreads using the AddrSpace, the 
AddrSpace can be removed. When the AddrSpace is removed, the rest of the 
memory being used by the AddrSpace are freed. The ProcessTable also updates
its entries and puts the exit value in case Join is called later.

# Join System Call

To implement Join, I needed a way to cause the thread calling Join to
sleep until the process with the spaceId finishes. A semaphore would
be able to provide this functionality. When Join is called, I create
a semaphore and add it to a Map in ProcessTables which maps a spaceId
to a semaphore. I then call P() on the semaphore. When a thread finishes 
running, its exit value is added to another Map in ProcessTable which 
maps the spaceId to its exit value. If there is a semaphore and an 
exitValue for a given spaceId, V() is called which allows the thread
that called Join to awake. The exitValue is then written into R2. To 
prevent semaphores for orphaned threads to build up, I use a callout 
to automatically awake the thread calling Join and remove the semaphore.

# Yield System Call

Yield is straightforward, I simply called Nachos.scheduler.yieldThread()
to have the current thread to yield the CPU.

Instructions
############

To print out debug messages that I added, add -d 0 to the run configuration.
For more insight on the different threads, I found -d t was useful as well.

To test user programs in the test subfolder, add -x test/prog-name to
the run configuration.

To test Exec and Exit, I wrote "exec.c" and compiled it wih the MIPS cross compiler.
By running this program, it executed the exit program which you also have to
compile. The output using -d 0 helps verify that this works.

To test Fork and Join, I wrote "fork.c". This program forks to a method
that calls Exec on the exec program and then joins it. The exit value
of the process with the specified spaceId is then returned and can be
verified in the output.
